This was a solo project created for my Spring 2025 DIG 4715C class. It uses the browser-based engine Bitsy, which emulates classic 8-bit consoles, most notably the Atari 2600. After learning how to use Unity and Unreal, which present the user with more than enough options, I had to learnt to work with the constraints of this system. Nonetheless, I'm proud of what I was able to do, including dialogue choices, password puzzles, and interactive minigames. This was accomplished with room transitions and avatar changes, changing the "avatar" from the main character to the menu assets.
